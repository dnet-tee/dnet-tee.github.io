# Website of the DistriNet TEE Group
Forked from [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)

Deployed at: https://dnet-tee.github.io/

## Installation
Run 
```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
sudo gem install jekyll bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

Technically, gem should not be run as root user and you can set this up properly if you want, see [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/).
